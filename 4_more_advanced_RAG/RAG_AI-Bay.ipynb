See also:  \\n**Pro Seller: How do I ship my package?**  \\n**Pro Seller: Steps for a sale with secure payment and in-store pickup**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What to Do if One or More Items in the Lot Are Unavailable?\\nIf one or more items in the lot are unavailable:  \\n✔ When a buyer purchases several of your items as a lot, you’ll be notified through the secure messaging system.  \\n✔ Click on “Is the order available?”  \\n✔ You can then view the contents of the lot created by the buyer and check whether all items are still available.  \\n✔ Click on “Cancel the sale,” then confirm by selecting “Yes, cancel the sale.”  \\n✔ Specify the reason for canceling the buyer’s order.  \\n✔ Communicate with the buyer via messaging to explain which items are unavailable (if applicable, remember to remove your listing).  \\n\\nThe buyer can then create a new lot and make a new purchase.\\n\\n**Note:** It’s not possible to modify a lot. If even one item is unavailable, you must cancel the entire sale. Partial refunds for lots are also not possible. In such cases, cancel the sale and start a new transaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What Are the Delivery Conditions for a Lot Purchase?\\n✔ All items in the lot must be grouped into a single package that meets the shipping criteria of the chosen carrier. You’ll receive one shipping label for the entire lot.  \\n✔ The items must share a common delivery or pickup method to be eligible. You’ll need to select a carrier from Mondial Relay, Colissimo, Shop2Shop, Relais Colis, or in-store pickup.  \\n✔ Lot purchases are not compatible with personalized delivery or tracked mail.  \\n✔ Weight and size limits depend on the carrier. Please review these conditions before shipping.  \\n✔ The delivery fee applied corresponds to the heaviest item in the lot. We recommend weighing your items when posting your listings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Can I Disable the Lot Purchase Option for My Profile?\\nIf your listings are eligible for lot purchases, this feature is automatically enabled. It cannot be disabled.\\n\\n**Note:** For more details, see the article “Pro Seller: My buyer can’t create a lot.”\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How Do Discounts on Lots Work?\\nWhen selling in lots, you can offer different discounts depending on the number of items selected by the buyer. This helps attract more buyers and sell faster while preparing only one package.\\n\\nThere are three item tiers for which discounts can be applied:  \\n- 2 items  \\n- 3 items  \\n- 5 items or more  \\n\\nYou cannot create additional tiers (for example, a 4-item lot).\\n\\nBy default, the following discount percentages apply:  \\n- 2 items: 5%  \\n- 3 items: 10%  \\n- 5 items or more: 20%\\n\\nYou can also set custom discount percentages for each tier: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, or 50%.  \\nFor the 2-item and 3-item tiers, offering a discount is optional. However, you must select a discount percentage for the 5-item (and more) tier.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How to Activate Lot Discounts\\nThis feature must be manually activated in your account settings by following these steps:\\n\\n**Via the mobile app:**  \\n✔ Go to “My Account.”  \\n✔ Under “Settings,” click on “Lot Discounts.”  \\n✔ Toggle the switch to the right of “Lot Discounts” to activate the feature.  \\n✔ From the dropdown menu, select the discount to apply for each item tier (2 items, 3 items, and 5 items or more). You may choose not to apply a discount for the 2-item and 3-item tiers. Changes are saved automatically and will apply to your future lot sales.  \\n✔ Click the toggle again to deactivate the option.\\n\\n**Via the website:**  \\n✔ Go to “My Account,” then click on “Settings.”  \\n✔ Scroll down to the “Discounts” section.  \\n✔ Click the switch on the left of the “Lot Discounts” box to activate discounts.  \\n✔ From the dropdown menu, select the discount to apply for each item tier (2 items, 3 items, and 5 items or more). Changes are saved automatically and will apply to your future lot sales.  \\n✔ Click the switch again to deactivate the option.\\n\\n**Note:** Lot purchases are not available for items in the “Wines and Gastronomy” category.',\n",
