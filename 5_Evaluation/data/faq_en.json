        "faq_body": "**The Steps for Selling in Lots**  \n**What to Do if One or More Items in the Lot Are Unavailable?**  \n**Can I Disable the Lot Purchase Option for My Profile?**\n\n---\n\n### The Steps for Selling in Lots\n✔ When a buyer purchases several of your items as a lot, you’ll be notified through the secure messaging system.  \n✔ Click on “Is the order available?”  \n✔ You can then view the contents of the lot created by the buyer and check whether all items are still available.  \n✔ Click on “Confirm availability.”  \n✔ The purchase is then validated, and you can proceed with shipping the package or arranging in-store pickup following the usual steps. See also:  \n**Pro Seller: How do I ship my package?**  \n**Pro Seller: Steps for a sale with secure payment and in-store pickup**\n\n---\n\n### What to Do if One or More Items in the Lot Are Unavailable?\nIf one or more items in the lot are unavailable:  \n✔ When a buyer purchases several of your items as a lot, you’ll be notified through the secure messaging system.  \n✔ Click on “Is the order available?”  \n✔ You can then view the contents of the lot created by the buyer and check whether all items are still available.  \n✔ Click on “Cancel the sale,” then confirm by selecting “Yes, cancel the sale.”  \n✔ Specify the reason for canceling the buyer’s order.  \n✔ Communicate with the buyer via messaging to explain which items are unavailable (if applicable, remember to remove your listing).  \n\nThe buyer can then create a new lot and make a new purchase.\n\n**Note:** It’s not possible to modify a lot. If even one item is unavailable, you must cancel the entire sale. Partial refunds for lots are also not possible. In such cases, cancel the sale and start a new transaction.\n\n---\n\n### What Are the Delivery Conditions for a Lot Purchase?\n✔ All items in the lot must be grouped into a single package that meets the shipping criteria of the chosen carrier. You’ll receive one shipping label for the entire lot.  \n✔ The items must share a common delivery or pickup method to be eligible. You’ll need to select a carrier from Mondial Relay, Colissimo, Shop2Shop, Relais Colis, or in-store pickup.  \n✔ Lot purchases are not compatible with personalized delivery or tracked mail.  \n✔ Weight and size limits depend on the carrier. Please review these conditions before shipping.  \n✔ The delivery fee applied corresponds to the heaviest item in the lot. We recommend weighing your items when posting your listings.\n\n---\n\n### Can I Disable the Lot Purchase Option for My Profile?\nIf your listings are eligible for lot purchases, this feature is automatically enabled. It cannot be disabled.\n\n**Note:** For more details, see the article “Pro Seller: My buyer can’t create a lot.”\n\n---\n\n### How Do Discounts on Lots Work?\nWhen selling in lots, you can offer different discounts depending on the number of items selected by the buyer. This helps attract more buyers and sell faster while preparing only one package.\n\nThere are three item tiers for which discounts can be applied:  \n- 2 items  \n- 3 items  \n- 5 items or more  \n\nYou cannot create additional tiers (for example, a 4-item lot).\n\nBy default, the following discount percentages apply:  \n- 2 items: 5%  \n- 3 items: 10%  \n- 5 items or more: 20%\n\nYou can also set custom discount percentages for each tier: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, or 50%.  \nFor the 2-item and 3-item tiers, offering a discount is optional. However, you must select a discount percentage for the 5-item (and more) tier.\n\n---\n\n### How to Activate Lot Discounts\nThis feature must be manually activated in your account settings by following these steps:\n\n**Via the mobile app:**  \n✔ Go to “My Account.”  \n✔ Under “Settings,” click on “Lot Discounts.”  \n✔ Toggle the switch to the right of “Lot Discounts” to activate the feature.  \n✔ From the dropdown menu, select the discount to apply for each item tier (2 items, 3 items, and 5 items or more). You may choose not to apply a discount for the 2-item and 3-item tiers. Changes are saved automatically and will apply to your future lot sales.  \n✔ Click the toggle again to deactivate the option.\n\n**Via the website:**  \n✔ Go to “My Account,” then click on “Settings.”  \n✔ Scroll down to the “Discounts” section.  \n✔ Click the switch on the left of the “Lot Discounts” box to activate discounts.  \n✔ From the dropdown menu, select the discount to apply for each item tier (2 items, 3 items, and 5 items or more). Changes are saved automatically and will apply to your future lot sales.  \n✔ Click the switch again to deactivate the option.\n\n**Note:** Lot purchases are not available for items in the “Wines and Gastronomy” category.",

Therefore, we recommend completing all the criteria shown when posting your ad.  \nSince the valuation is based on data from our partner Argus, it will display a price range that reflects your vehicle’s market value. This data is updated daily to ensure accuracy and consistency.  \nHowever, your vehicle’s sale price may differ from the displayed valuation depending on its condition — for example, damage, worn parts, or additional/new equipment.  \nNote that optional equipment is not currently factored into the valuation, so be sure to mention it in your listing description.  \nYou’ll receive a confirmation message once your listing is live.  \nSecure payment for used vehicles is automatically enabled for all eligible listings (with or without the Serenity Pack), so there’s nothing extra you need to do.\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the vehicle’s availability**  \nWhen a buyer is interested, they can initiate the payment process through your listing. You’ll receive a notification in the secure messaging system asking you to confirm the vehicle’s availability.  \nTo do this:  \n- Open the relevant conversation in secure messaging.  \n- Click “Available” to confirm that your vehicle is still for sale.\n\n**Step 3: Wait for the buyer’s funds to be deposited into the secure AI-Bay account**  \nOnce you’ve confirmed availability, the buyer deposits the funds into their AI-Bay account. You’ll receive a notification via secure messaging once the funds have been successfully deposited.  \n\n*Note:* At this stage, you do not receive any payment yet. The funds are held in the buyer’s AI-Bay account until the vehicle verification is complete.  \nYou can also proceed with identity verification (available in your profile section).\n\n**Step 4: Meet the buyer to show the vehicle and finalize the sale**  \nArrange a meeting with the buyer so they can inspect the vehicle. If satisfied, the buyer confirms the sale and releases the funds via secure messaging, transferring them to your AI-Bay account.  \nWait for the notification confirming that the buyer has released the funds before handing over the keys.\n\n**Step 5: Transfer the funds to your bank account**  \nOnce the buyer releases the funds, they become available in your AI-Bay account. To transfer them to your bank account:  \n- If not already done, enter your IBAN and complete identity verification in your AI-Bay profile section.  \n- Go to the secure messaging conversation related to the sale. You’ll see a notification confirming the buyer’s payment.  \n- Click “Transfer funds” and confirm the operation.  \nThe sale is now complete!",

Be cautious of requests for personal information via email, SMS, or messaging. Watch out for spelling or typographical errors in messages, and be wary of messages that do not directly relate to your listing.  \n---END PREVIEW---\n\n**Note:** If you believe you are a victim of cybercrime, you can perform a diagnostic and consult government recommendations on the website 17cyber.gouv.fr.\n\n### Avoiding Fraud Attempts\n#### Recognizing Suspicious Behavior from the First Messages\n#### Identifying a Fraudulent Email\n#### Best Practices for Securing Your Transactions\n#### What to Do When Facing Suspicious Behavior\n\n### Avoiding Fraud Attempts\nWe have implemented features to protect you as much as possible when shopping on our platform. To secure all your exchanges and transactions on our website and apps, we recommend:\n✔ Always use the secure messaging system for your communications  \n✔ Use AI‑Bay’s secure payment service to protect your transaction funds  \n\nWe cannot guarantee any actions performed outside of AI‑Bay’s secure messaging and payment systems.\n\n✔ For every transaction, we notify you within AI‑Bay’s messaging system about each step.  \nIf you receive a payment confirmation email that does not appear in your messaging, do not proceed with any shipment.\n\nIf in doubt, our teams are available to help via our contact form. Please provide as much information as possible: screenshots/links, phone number, email, listing ID, etc.\n\n### Recognizing Suspicious Behavior from the First Exchanges\n#### Warning Signs of Scams\nIf someone asks for verification codes, bank card numbers, or sensitive personal information, be cautious. Be especially wary of urgent requests, particularly those involving money.\n\n#### Be Careful with Requests for Personal Information via Email, SMS, or Messaging\nIf you receive a request to share personal data (email, phone number, ID documents, bank details, etc.) or a message containing an external link, it may be fraudulent. This could be a phishing or smishing attempt.\n\n#### Watch for Spelling or Typographical Errors\nIf messages contain spelling mistakes or awkward phrasing, this may indicate suspicious behavior.\n\nFraudulent emails can easily include AI‑Bay’s logos and color codes.\n\n#### Be Wary of Messages Unrelated to the Listing\nIf a message does not directly reference the item for sale or remains vague, it may come from a malicious person.\n\n#### Be Cautious with Messages Containing QR Codes\nAI‑Bay will never ask you to validate a payment via a QR code in secure messaging. If you receive an attachment or image with a QR code, do not scan it—it may be a fraud attempt.\n\n#### Be Wary of Phone Calls Claiming to Be from AI‑Bay\nAn AI‑Bay customer service agent will never call you to request bank details or payment by phone. If someone calls pretending to be from AI‑Bay, it’s a scam. Do not respond—block and report the number.\n\n### Recognizing a Fraudulent Email\n#### Check the Sender’s Email Address\nOfficial AI‑Bay email addresses:\n✔ @ai-bay.fr  \n✔ @news.ai-bay.fr  \n✔ @messaging.ai-bay.fr  \n\nAny email from another address is suspicious, for example:  \n✘ @ai-bayfr.fr  \n✘ @payment-ai-bay.fr  \n✘ @services-ai-bay.fr  \n✘ @secure-transaction-ai-bay.com  \n✘ @safe-delivery-ai-bay.com  \n\n#### Example of a Fraudulent Email\n**Warning Signs:**\n- The email address is not an official AI‑Bay address.  \n- The subject line is in all caps and mentions another email address.  \n- The body contains spelling errors.  \n- The signature uses English terms.  \n- The overall design is inconsistent.\n\n**Sellers:** Be cautious if you receive a payment confirmation email asking you to ship only via Chronopost.  \nDo not send your package unless you have discussed the delivery method with the buyer through AI‑Bay’s messaging system.\n\n### Best Practices for Securing Your Transactions\nAvoid using external payment methods such as Mandat Cash, Western Union, Paylib, Transacash, or QR code payments, or any platform imitating existing ones. Do not send cash or checks by mail, DHL, or abroad.\n\nWe cannot guarantee the safety of transactions made outside our services.\n\n#### Be Careful When Sharing Banking Information\nOnly your AI‑Bay RIB allows you to transfer money to your escrow account.  \nThe AI‑Bay RIB:  \n✘ Will never be sent by email, SMS, or screenshot in messaging.  \n✔ Is accessible only via a button in your conversation with the other party.\n\n**Example of an AI‑Bay RIB:**  \nCheck the RIB/IBAN details. The first two letters of the IBAN indicate the country code—French accounts begin with “FR.” If in doubt, continue the transaction using secure payment.\n\nAI‑Bay recommends not sharing your banking information.\n\n**Sellers:** Be cautious if a buyer claims to have made a payment but you see no trace of it in secure messaging or on the Transaction page. Do not proceed or ship the item unless the transaction is validated in messaging.\n\n### What to Do When Facing Suspicious Behavior\nNever leave AI‑Bay’s messaging system or make payments outside AI‑Bay’s secure payment service.  \nIf you notice suspicious behavior:\n- **Report the user:** How to report a user?  \n- **Block the user immediately:** How to block a user?  \n\nIf you receive:\n- A suspicious SMS: report it to the SMS spam control center at 33700.  \n- A suspicious email: block the sender and forward the details to us.",

If the sale is canceled, you are fully refunded.  \n\n**As a Seller:**  \n✔ The service is completely free.  \n✔ You can confirm that the buyer has sufficient funds before the meeting.  \n✔ You receive your money safely before handing over the keys.  \n\n### How Does Secure Payment Work?\n✔ The seller posts a vehicle listing. If eligible, secure payment is automatically activated.  \n✔ The buyer views the listing and initiates a secure purchase online, sending a request to confirm availability.  \n✔ The seller confirms the vehicle’s availability.  \n✔ The buyer transfers funds to an AI‑Bay secure RIB, which acts as an intermediary between the buyer’s and seller’s bank accounts until the transaction is complete.  \n✔ Once the funds are received, the seller verifies their identity.  \n✔ The money is held securely during the transaction.  \n✔ The buyer and seller meet, and the buyer inspects the vehicle.  \n✔ If satisfied, the buyer releases the funds to the seller’s AI‑Bay account.  \n✔ The seller receives the funds instantly, and the buyer leaves with the vehicle.  \n✔ The seller transfers the funds to their bank account.  \n✔ If there was negotiation, the buyer can recover any remaining funds from their AI‑Bay secure account.\n\n### Security and Precautions\n✔ We notify you at every step via AI‑Bay’s secure messaging—only these notifications are valid.  \n✔ If you receive an email or SMS prompting you to act, always verify that the corresponding notification appears in your AI‑Bay messaging.  \n✔ The RIB for your AI‑Bay secure account is accessible only via the “Deposit My Funds” button in your messaging.  \n✔ If in doubt, do not act and contact our customer service.  \n✘ Beware of offers that seem too good to be true, such as extremely low prices. Ask your seller plenty of questions.  \n✘ If the seller pressures you to pay quickly, remember that this is a major purchase—take your time.  \n✔ Payment to the seller should occur during the meeting, not before, to avoid unpleasant surprises. The transaction in favor of the seller is final and irreversible.\n\n### How Is the AI‑Bay RIB Sent?\n✔ Buyers receive the AI‑Bay RIB via AI‑Bay’s secure messaging.  \n✘ For security reasons, this RIB is never sent by email.  \n✘ Receiving a RIB as a PDF, screenshot, or link is likely a fraud attempt—AI‑Bay will never send it that way.  \n✘ Do not click on links inviting you to leave the platform via messaging or SMS—they may be phishing attempts.\n\n**Warning:** Any email instructing you to make a secure AI‑Bay payment via an attached RIB is fraudulent.\n\n### How Are My Documents Verified?\nDocuments related to your banking identity are handled by a payment service provider called MangoPay for vehicle purchases.  \nFor collecting and verifying this information, AI‑Bay acts solely as a technical service provider, allowing users to fill in, modify, or update their information for MangoPay via the AI‑Bay site.  \nMangoPay’s verification processes are separate and independent from any checks AI‑Bay may perform under its Terms of Service.",

For more information, click here.  \nIf you believe you are a victim of cybercrime, you can perform a diagnostic and consult official recommendations on the website 17cyber.gouv.fr.  \n\nWhat is a delivery scam?  \nThis type of scam falls under the category of cybercrime known as phishing, which involves impersonating a well-known brand or organization to trick victims into revealing personal or confidential information.  \nIn the case of parcel delivery scams, victims receive a message (email or SMS) that appears to come from delivery companies such as La Poste, Colissimo, DPD, Chronopost, UPS, etc. The message then redirects to a fraudulent website where personal information may be requested — such as your name, postal or email address, or phone number.  \n\nI received a suspicious delivery message — what should I do?  \nFirst, know that legitimate delivery companies will never ask you to make a payment by SMS or email to receive a parcel.  \nIf in doubt:  \n- Contact the delivery company directly to confirm the message you received.  \n- Do not open suspicious messages or attachments, and never click on the links they contain.  \n- Hover your mouse over any suspicious link (without clicking) to see the real address and verify its authenticity.  \n- If you clicked on a link, check the website address in your browser. If it doesn’t exactly match the official site, it’s likely fraudulent.  \n- Report any suspicious email or website to Signal Spam. For SMS messages, report them to the 33700 platform or by texting 33 700.  \n- Report phishing website addresses to Phishing Initiative, which will block and request removal of the fraudulent site.  \n- Also report suspicious messages and websites to the delivery companies whose identities have been impersonated.  \n- Report the scam attempt on the Ministry of the Interior’s platform: Internet-signalement.gouv.fr.  \n\nI’m a victim of a delivery scam — what should I do?  \n- Contact the legitimate delivery company to confirm the scam.  \n- Immediately block your payment method with your bank.  \n- Keep the message and the malicious website address as evidence.  \n- If you notice fraudulent charges on your bank card, report them on the Ministry of the Interior’s Perceval platform.  \n- File a complaint with the authorities.  \n- Contact your bank to request reimbursement.  \n- For advice, contact the Ministry of the Interior’s Info Escroqueries helpline at 0 805 805 817.",

        "faq_body": "Note: This article includes recommendations partly taken from the French government website cybermalveillance.gouv.fr. For more information, click here.  \n\nUsing Secure Payment  \nAI-Bay’s secure payment system allows you to carry out simple and safe transactions between individuals directly through your messaging. It’s the safest way to make your purchases.  \nBy using secure payment, you benefit from AI-Bay’s protection, which keeps your money safe until the transaction is completed.  \nIf you prefer to meet sellers in person, note that secure payment can also be used for face-to-face transactions through the in-person handover system.  \n\nIf You Don’t Want to Use Secure Payment  \nIf you choose not to use AI-Bay’s secure payment, be especially cautious about who you’re dealing with and watch for suspicious behavior. AI-Bay cannot protect you from fraudulent transactions made outside the platform.  \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:  \n✔ Be wary of offers that seem too good to be true.  \n✔ Check the seller’s profile — the “recommended profile” badge and rating can help you assess their reliability.  \n✘ Never send cash or checks by mail or courier abroad, and avoid external payment methods such as Mandat Cash or Western Union.  \n✘ Do not share personal information (bank details, ID documents, etc.).  \n\nNote: If you believe you are a victim of cybercrime, you can perform a diagnostic and consult official recommendations on the website 17cyber.gouv.fr.",

After that, the transaction is automatically canceled.  \nSee “Private Seller: How to Confirm Product Availability and Trigger the Sale?”  \n\nImportant: If the in-person handover does not occur within 30 days after confirming product availability, the transaction amount will automatically be transferred to you. Before this deadline, either you or the buyer can cancel the transaction at any time via your messaging or transaction details.  \n\nStep 4: Arrange a Meeting with the Buyer  \nOnce the purchase is confirmed, it’s time to hand over the item to its new owner. Communicate with the buyer through AI-Bay’s secure messaging to arrange a meeting.  \n\nNote: On the day of the meeting, make sure your phone is charged and connected to the internet to complete the final steps of the sale.  \n\nStep 5: The Buyer Checks the Product  \nOn the meeting day, the buyer verifies that the product matches the description and triggers the payment through AI-Bay’s secure messaging.  \n\nWarning: Wait until you receive confirmation that the buyer has triggered your payment via AI-Bay’s secure messaging before handing over the item.  \n\nStep 6: Receive Your Payment  \nYou’ll receive the payment in your AI-Bay wallet.  \n\nNote: Regardless of the payment method chosen by the buyer, you’ll receive the full amount once the transaction is finalized.

To modify this setting, see “How to activate bundle discounts.” The buyer can also make an offer on bundles, with or without active discounts.\n\n**What to do if one or more items in the bundle are unavailable**  \nIf one or more items in the bundle are unavailable:  \n✔ When a buyer purchases several of your items as a bundle, you’ll be notified via secure messaging.  \n✔ Click “Is the order available?”  \n✔ You can then view the bundle and check item availability.  \n✔ Click “Cancel sale,” then confirm by selecting “Yes, cancel sale.”  \n✔ Specify the reason for canceling the buyer’s order.  \n✔ Communicate with the buyer via messaging to explain which items are unavailable (and remember to remove your listing if necessary).  \n\nThe buyer can then create a new bundle and make a new purchase.\n\n*Note:* It’s not possible to modify a bundle. If even one item is unavailable, you must cancel the entire sale. Partial refunds are also not possible for bundles — cancel the sale and start a new transaction instead.\n\n**Delivery conditions for a bundle purchase**  \n✔ All items in the bundle must be packed in a single parcel that meets the chosen carrier’s shipping requirements. You’ll receive one shipping label for the entire bundle.  \n✔ Items must have at least one delivery method selected to be eligible: choose a carrier among Mondial Relay, Colissimo, Shop2Shop, or hand delivery.  \n✔ Bundle purchases are not compatible with personalized delivery or Courrier Suivi.  \n✔ Weight and size limits depend on the carrier; please review these before shipping.  \n✔ The delivery fee applied is based on the heaviest item in the bundle. We recommend weighing your items when posting your listings.\n\n**Can I disable bundle purchases for my profile?**  \nIf your listings are eligible for bundle purchases, this feature is automatically enabled. It cannot be disabled.\n\n**How do bundle discounts work?**  \nWhen selling in bundles, you can offer different discounts depending on the number of items selected by the buyer. This helps attract more buyers and sell faster while preparing only one parcel.  \nDonations and €0 items added to a bundle are not included in the discount calculation.  \nThere are three discount tiers based on the number of items: 2 items, 3 items, and 5 or more items. You cannot create additional tiers (e.g., a 4-item bundle).  \nBy default, the following discount percentages apply:  \n- 2 items: 5%  \n- 3 items: 10%  \n- 5 or more items: 20%  \n\nYou can also set custom discount percentages for each tier: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, or 50%.  \nFor the 2-item and 3-item tiers, offering a discount is optional. However, you must select a discount percentage for the 5+ item tier.\n\n**How to activate bundle discounts**  \nThis feature must be manually activated in your account settings:\n\n*Via the mobile app:*  \n✔ Go to “My Account.”  \n✔ Under “Settings,” click “Bundle Discounts.”  \n✔ Toggle the switch next to “Bundle Discounts” to activate.  \n✔ Select from the dropdown menu the discount to apply for each tier (2 items, 3 items, and 5+ items).

Fraudsters may obtain card details through various methods: phishing messages prompting victims to share their information, hacking an online account where card details are stored (e-commerce, social networks, etc.), compromising a victim’s device (computer, phone, etc.), or exploiting a data breach from a website where the victim previously entered their card details.\n\nHow can you protect yourself from credit card fraud?  \nX Never share your banking details via messaging, phone, or the Internet (unless through a certified organization).  \n✔ Keep your credit card safe.  \n✔ Regularly check your bank account.  \nX Do not save your card details and remove them from sites you no longer use.  \n✔ Verify the reputation of websites before making purchases.  \n✔ Use secure payment methods.  \nX Do not open suspicious messages or attachments, and never click on links they contain.  \n✔ Use strong, unique passwords for each site and app.  \n✔ Enable two-factor authentication.  \n✔ Regularly update your devices and their software or apps.  \nX Avoid connecting through public computers or Wi-Fi networks.\n\nMy card was used by someone else — what should I do?  \n✔ Immediately block your credit card.  \n✔ Contact your bank as soon as possible to request a refund for any fraudulent charges.  \n✔ Report the fraud to the Ministry of the Interior’s Perceval platform.  \n✔ File a complaint with the authorities.  \n✔ Ensure none of your online accounts have been compromised, and change your passwords.  \n✔ Update your devices to fix any potential security vulnerabilities.",

If needed, check our “Search and Browse Listings” section for tips.  \n✔ From the results, choose the listing you want. In-person handover with secure payment is available for all categories listed on this page.  \n\n**Step 2: Choose in-person handover**  \nTwo scenarios are possible: the seller may have enabled delivery or only in-person handover. See “Buyer: Steps for a Secure Payment and Delivery Purchase.”  \n\n*If the listing offers delivery*  \nIf the “Delivery available” badge appears, the seller also offers delivery.  \nIn this case, click “Buy,” then select “In-person handover” from the delivery options.  \n\n*If the listing does not offer delivery*  \nIf there is no “Delivery available” badge, in-person handover is the only option.  \n✔ From the listing, click “Buy.”  \n✔ A message will confirm that the exchange will take place in person.  \n\n**Step 3: Proceed with payment**  \n✔ Click “Step 2/2: Pay.”  \n✔ Enter your card details.  \n✔ Click “Pay.”  \n\n**Note:** Your money is not immediately transferred to the seller.

Then, communicate to agree on a meeting time.  \n\n⚠️ Important: If the in-person handover does not occur within 30 days after the seller confirms availability, the transaction amount will automatically be released to the seller. Before this deadline, only the seller can cancel the transaction via your messaging or the transaction details page.  \n\n**Step 5: Trigger payment face-to-face**  \nOn the day of the meeting, bring your mobile phone.  \n✔ Check that the item matches the description.  \n✔ Open AI-Bay’s secure messaging on your phone.  \n✔ Go to the conversation related to the transaction.  \n✔ If everything is correct, click “Trigger payment.”  \n✔ The seller will be notified that the transaction is complete and will hand over the item.  \n\n⚠️ Important: If you realize the item is not as described after triggering payment, AI-Bay’s team will no longer be able to intervene (see Article 3.5 of our Terms of Use).

When a listing is eligible for secure payment, the “Serenity Pack” or “Secure Payment” badge will appear.  \n\n**Step 2: Check the vehicle’s availability**  \nTo start the purchase process via secure payment:  \n✔ From the listing or chat, click “Reserve.”  \n✔ You’ll be redirected to a page explaining how secure payment works, or to the Serenity Pack details page if applicable. At the bottom, click “Reserve my vehicle.”  \n✔ A message will be sent to the seller asking them to confirm the vehicle’s availability.  \n\n*Note:* Feel free to contact the seller beforehand through the secure chat to ask for additional information.  \n\n**Step 3: Choose the Mechanical Breakdown Warranty (for Serenity Pack listings only)**  \nOnce the seller confirms availability, you can select your warranty duration:  \n✔ From the chat, click “Choose my warranty.”  \n✔ A page will explain the Mechanical Breakdown Warranty and let you choose the duration (3, 6, or 12 months).  \n\n*Note:* If you don’t want the warranty, click “I don’t want to insure my car.” In that case, a €19.99 service fee applies.  \n\n**Step 4: Confirm your purchase details**  \nA summary of your purchase will appear. Review the information and click “Confirm.”  \n\n*Note:* If you left the process after selecting your warranty, you can resume it from your chat by clicking “Deposit my funds,” which will take you back to the summary page.  \n\n**Step 5: Enter your personal information**  \nTo finalize your purchase request and create your secure AI-Bay account, you’ll need to provide your first and last name.  \n\n*Note:* If your name is already saved in your AI-Bay profile, this step will be skipped, and your secure account will be created automatically.  \n\n**Step 6: Deposit your funds into your secure AI-Bay account**  \nOnce your purchase is confirmed, you can deposit the funds into your secure AI-Bay account:  \n✔ You can access your secure account’s bank details (RIB) right after confirming your purchase or later via the chat by clicking “Deposit my funds.”  \n✔ Log in to your bank account and add this RIB as a beneficiary.  \n✔ Make the transfer for the vehicle’s amount.  \n✔ You’ll receive a notification once your transfer has arrived in your secure AI-Bay account (usually within 1–3 business days).  \n\nThe AI-Bay RIB acts as an intermediary between you and the seller. You can cancel at any time and have your funds returned to your bank account. If you negotiate a new price, you can also recover the remaining balance after payment and transfer it back to your account.  \n\n**Warning:** If you receive a RIB by email or SMS, it’s a fraud attempt. AI-Bay will never send you this information by email—it’s only accessible via a button in your chat.  \n\n**Step 7: Inspect the vehicle in person and confirm the transfer of funds**  \nArrange a meeting with the seller and carefully inspect the vehicle. Once you’re satisfied, confirm the transfer of funds to the seller:  \n✔ Go to your chat with the seller in the secure messaging system.  \n✔ Click “Pay.”  \n✔ A payment summary will appear. Check the amount and click “Confirm.” You can manually adjust the amount if you negotiated a new price. Any remaining funds can be returned to your bank account afterward.  \n✔ By clicking “Confirm,” the funds are transferred to the seller.  \n\n**Warning:** This action is irreversible.

These scams are typically carried out via phone calls and/or emails and can target any type of organization.  \n\n---\n\n**How to protect yourself from fake transfer orders:**  \n- Use strong, unique passwords for each website and app.  \n- Enable two-factor authentication.  \n- Limit the publication of information that could identify or contact people authorized to make transfers.  \n- Educate staff who may handle transfer requests about phishing risks.  \n- Always verify the authenticity of organizations providing bank details for payments.  \n\n---\n\n**If you’re a victim of fraudulent transfers:**  \n✔ Identify the fraudulent transactions.  \n✔ Immediately alert your bank and request a recall of the funds.  \n✔ Ask for the transfer to be suspended.  \n✔ Keep all evidence.  \n✔ If the fraud involved a hacked email account, change its password immediately.  \n✔ File a police report.",

If unavailable, you can request it from the seller by clicking **Request History Report**.  \n\nTake your time when choosing a used vehicle — such a significant purchase requires careful research and consideration.  \n\n---\n\n### Test-driving and inspecting a used vehicle before purchase\nA test drive is essential — never buy a vehicle without driving it first.  \nInspect the vehicle in daylight, when it’s dry, and from all possible angles.  \nIdeally, the first start should be done when the engine is cold.  \nAsk the seller plenty of questions: How was the vehicle used? Why are you selling it? Has it ever been in an accident or repaired?  \n\nFind the full checklist of things to verify during a test drive on the AI-Bay used vehicle buyer’s checklist.  \n\n---\n\n### Things to check at the time of sale\nVerify the seller’s identity by asking for an ID or passport.  \nThe following documents must be provided to the buyer at the time of sale:  \n- The certificate of transfer  \n- The maintenance logbook and invoices  \n- The registration certificate  \n- The administrative status certificate  \n- The technical inspection report  \n\nChoose the payment method that suits you best: check, bank check, cash, or AI-Bay secure payment.  \n\nFind more details in the article *How does secure payment work for used vehicles?*  \n\nYou can negotiate the price — this is possible with AI-Bay secure payment.  \nTo protect your vehicle, you can subscribe to the mechanical breakdown warranty, available as part of the Serenity Pack with secure payment. More information is available on this page.  \n\nDon’t forget to insure your vehicle appropriately — all motor vehicles (even those not in use) must at least have third-party liability insurance.  \n\n---\n\n### Vehicle registration\nThe buyer has one month to register the vehicle in their name. Within 15 days of the sale, the seller must declare the transfer. The buyer must have the transfer code (provided by the seller) to register the vehicle.  \n\n**Note:** Find all information about vehicle registration on the official ANTS government website.",

        "faq_title": "**Title:** Safety Tips for Families",
        "faq_body": "Note: For more information, please refer to the complete guide for families available on cybermalveillance.gouv.fr.\n\nNote: If you believe you are a victim of cybercrime, you can perform a diagnostic and consult government recommendations on 17cyber.gouv.fr.\n\n**Preventive Measures for Parents**\n\n1. **Protect your accounts with strong passwords**  \nTo reduce risks and prevent hacking of your various online accounts, we recommend using long, complex, and unique passwords for each of your devices and services. If you have any doubts—or simply as a precaution—don’t hesitate to change them and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible to strengthen your security.  \nFinally, use a password manager to store them safely.\n\n2. **Keep all your devices updated**  \nAccept security updates on all your devices (computers, tablets, mobile phones, connected objects, etc.) as soon as they are available to fix vulnerabilities and protect yourself.  \nWe also recommend regularly checking in your device and software settings that updates are properly applied, and enabling automatic download and installation if possible.  \nAlways download updates only from official websites to avoid downloading malware.  \nSee also: *How to update your app?*\n\n3. **Use antivirus software**  \nWe recommend installing antivirus protection on all your devices (computer, tablet, mobile phone, etc.). There are many free and paid options depending on your needs and desired level of protection.  \nRegularly check that your antivirus software is up to date and perform full scans to ensure your system is not infected.\n\n4. **Be cautious when shopping online**  \nCybercriminals are increasingly creative in their attempts to deceive you: phishing messages via SMS, email, or phone, fake promotional offers (discounts, gifts, etc.), fake e-commerce sites (especially around holidays), fake “official” websites, fake delivery services, or fake order confirmations.  \nTheir goal: to steal your personal or banking data, trick you into paying for goods you’ll never receive, call premium-rate numbers, or subscribe to paid services without your consent.  \nTo avoid such fraud, always check the website address where you make your payment—sometimes a single character difference can indicate a fake site.  \nUse the most secure payment methods and never use external payment systems (such as Money Order, Western Union, etc.).  \nSee: *How to secure my purchases on AI-Bay?*\n\n5. **Beware of suspicious messages**  \nYour first reflex should be not to click on any links you receive. If you get an unexpected or alarming message, hover your mouse over the link to see the full URL—it may be a phishing attempt.  \nSee: *A message or SMS seems suspicious—what should I do?*\n\n6. **Avoid public or unknown Wi-Fi networks**  \nOutside your home, prefer using your mobile data connection (3G, 4G, or 5G) instead of public Wi-Fi. If you must use public Wi-Fi, carefully verify the network name and never perform sensitive actions (credit card payments, checking bank accounts, entering confidential information, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**How to Talk About Cybersecurity with Your Children**\n\n1. **Raise awareness about risks**  \nChildren are exposed to digital tools daily but often unaware of the risks (cyberbullying, data theft, account hacking, etc.). It’s important to educate them and help them develop good habits from an early age.\n\n2. **Monitor the content children access**  \nJust like adults, children can encounter shocking or illegal content: hate speech, terrorist propaganda, child exploitation, etc. Supervising minors’ internet use is therefore essential.\n\n3. **Report inappropriate behavior**  \nCyberbullying, insults, defamation, corruption of minors, or incitement to commit crimes—if you encounter illegal content online, report it on the Ministry of the Interior’s website: www.internet-signalement.gouv.fr.  \nYou can also find information on these risks at 3018.\n\n4. **Make children aware of punishable behavior**  \nYoung people may feel anonymous online and act without realizing the consequences. However, the internet is not a lawless space, and absolute anonymity does not exist.  \nJust like in the real world, laws apply online. Depending on the offense, individuals can face fines of several thousand euros or even imprisonment.\n\n---\n\n**Important:** The use of our platform is prohibited for minors. As a parent or legal guardian, if a minor under your responsibility has created an account on AI-Bay, please help them delete it.",

        "faq_body": "**How is the payment for a booking divided?**\n\nFor each booking, the traveler pays a portion as a deposit (between 30% and 100% of the total price, determined by the host when posting the listing), and the remaining balance upon arrival using the payment method chosen by the host.\n\n**Receiving the deposit**  \nWhen you post your vacation rental listing, you set the deposit amount to be paid by the traveler. This can range from 30% to 100% of the total booking amount.\n\n*Tip:* Choosing a 100% deposit ensures a fully secure online transaction.\n\nOnline booking builds trust between the host and the traveler. To guarantee the traveler’s accommodation and the host’s payment, the deposit process occurs in two steps:\n\n- Upon acceptance of the booking request: the deposit is charged to the traveler’s account. Your funds are then secured by AI-Bay. On your wallet page, the deposit appears under “Upcoming amounts” but is not yet available in your wallet.  \n- 48 hours after the travelers arrive: the deposit amount is transferred to your AI-Bay wallet. You can then transfer it to your bank account or use it for purchases or bookings on AI-Bay.\n\n**Receiving the remaining balance**  \nThe deposit covers only part of the booking price. The remaining balance must be paid by the traveler upon arrival.  \nAI-Bay does not handle this part of the payment. You can arrange directly with the traveler to choose the appropriate payment method (cash, bank transfer, etc.).\n\n*Note:* If you requested a 100% deposit, no additional payment is required.\n\nThe tourist tax is included in the traveler’s online payment and is automatically transferred by AI-Bay to the relevant municipalities.",

Be cautious to prevent fraudulent use.\n\n**Share your tenant file only with trusted landlords**  \nBefore sharing your tenant file, make sure you’re dealing with a trustworthy landlord. Here are some indicators of a reliable one:  \n- A professional landlord (real estate agency) with a detailed profile and multiple listings.  \n- A landlord account with positive reviews.  \n- Several varied listings.  \n- Serious and consistent communication through the secure messaging system.  \n\nBe especially cautious if:  \n- The listing seems suspicious (very low price, overly professional photos—“too good to be true”).  \n- The landlord asks to communicate outside the secure messaging system.  \n- The landlord’s AI-Bay account was created very recently (you can check this by clicking their username).\n\n*Note:* If you later have doubts about a landlord, you can revoke their access to your tenant file at any time from your account.\n\n**Hide sensitive information on your documents**  \nTo reduce the risk of identity theft, hide sensitive details that landlords don’t need: passport number, ID number, social security number, employee ID, tax number, etc.  \nYou can use the “redact” function in your PDF reader or any image editor.\n\n*Note:* To prevent fraudulent use, your documents are automatically watermarked with “Tenant File.”\n\n**Who can I share my attachments with?**  \n*Note:* You can only share your tenant file attachments with verified landlords.\n\nYou can send your attachments to verified private or professional landlords.  \nYou cannot send them to unverified private landlords* or unverified professional landlords**.  \n*Your documents cannot be sent to a private landlord who has not verified their identity.*  \n**Your documents can only be sent to professional landlords with verified and established AI-Bay accounts.**\n\nWhen sending your file, you’ll see the landlord’s verification status:  \n- If verified, you’ll see the option “▢ Attach my complete file” when sending your first message and in your secure messaging.  \n- If not verified, you’ll only see the option “▢ Attach my file without supporting documents.”",

To make online transactions safer and reduce fraud by introducing a new 3-D Secure standard. Each online payment must be authenticated using at least two of the following factors:  \n\n- Entering a personal password  \n- Verifying ownership of the device  \n- Identification through biometric data (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.)  \n\n**How to authenticate a payment on AI-Bay?**  \nWhat does this mean for your purchases? In most cases, authentication works as follows:  \n✔ You make a purchase on the AI-Bay website or app.  \n✔ You open your mobile banking app.  \n✔ You confirm the payment by entering a password or using fingerprint recognition.  \n✔ The payment is validated, and you return to AI-Bay.  \n\n*Note:* This system complements SMS authentication, which only verified one of the three factors (device ownership).  \n\n**Are all purchases affected?**  \nSome transactions are not subject to PSD2:  \n\n- Low-risk transactions: when the bank considers the buyer’s fraud rate low and the payment solution has an effective risk analysis system.  \n- Recurring or split payments (of a fixed amount), after the first payment.  \n- Payments under €30: limited to 5 consecutive transactions and a total of €100 per day.  \n- Phone sales.  \n- Transactions outside the Eurozone.  \n- Payments made through corporate channels, such as travel agencies.",

        "faq_body": "### Important Information – Annual Sales Reports\nDear users,  \nWe have identified some irregularities in certain annual sales reports. Our teams are analyzing them to provide you with corrected reports as soon as possible. Please be patient.  \nThe corrections will also be sent to the DGFiP to update your tax declarations.  \nWe apologize for the inconvenience.  \n**AI-Bay Customer Service**\n\n---\n\n### General Information\n**Who is affected by this directive?**  \n**I buy a lot of second-hand goods — am I impacted by this law?**  \n**Do I already have to pay taxes on my sales?**  \n**What data is shared, with whom, and when?**  \n**Where can I find my tax identification number?**  \n**How do I provide my tax number?**  \n**What happens if I don’t complete the DAC7 form?**  \n**Where can I find my transaction history?**\n\n---\n\n### General Information\nThe DAC7 directive is a European Union (EU) tax directive requiring online platforms to report information about their members’ sales and income to tax authorities.  \n**AI-Bay** is legally required to collect and share certain income and seller information with tax authorities for users who meet specific conditions. If you are affected, you’ll be asked to provide your taxpayer details and confirm your personal information by completing a DAC7 form.  \nMore details are available in the section “What data is shared, with whom, and when?”  \nThis directive has been in effect since January 1, 2023, and reports must be submitted annually. The first report is due by January 31, 2024 (for the 2023 calendar year).\n\n*(Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 of March 22, 2021, amending Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. France applies this directive under Articles 1649b A to 1649b E of the General Tax Code.)*\n\n---\n\n**Important Note:**  \nThis concerns sales only. The number of ads you post does not matter. Only completed transactions on our platform are reported.  \nIf you do not use **AI-Bay’s** secure payment system, you don’t need to take any action for now.\n\n---\n\n### Who Is Affected by This Directive?\n**Sales of Goods**  \nYou are affected as a seller if, in 2023 or 2024, you meet one of the following conditions:  \n- At least 30 completed transactions and/or  \n- €2,000 or more in earnings.  \n\nWe will contact you if you meet these conditions. You’ll receive an email and a notification on **AI-Bay** with next steps and additional information required.  \nOnce the data has been transmitted to the tax authorities, we’ll inform you again about the scope and content of the data shared.\n\n**Note:** If you don’t meet these conditions, no further information is required from you.\n\n**Vacation Rentals**  \nThis directive also applies to users earning income from short-term accommodation rentals, regardless of the number of rentals or total income.  \nWe’ll inform you of the next steps and any additional information needed.  \nWhen the data is transmitted to the tax authorities, you’ll again be notified of the scope and content of the data shared.\n\n---\n\n### I Buy a Lot of Second-Hand Goods — Am I Impacted?\nNo. This only applies to sellers. No buyer information will be transmitted.\n\n---\n\n### Do I Already Have to Pay Taxes on My Sales?\nYou may not owe taxes on your sales — it depends on your situation.  \nEven if you meet the thresholds and your data is shared with tax authorities, this does not necessarily affect your personal tax obligations. You are only taxed on profits — that is, if you sell an item for more than you originally paid.  \nFor more details, consult your local tax authority or an independent tax advisor.\n\n---\n\n### What Data Is Shared, With Whom, and When?\nThis data will be sent to the French tax authorities, and we’ll notify you when it happens.  \nThe information remains valid for at least 36 months. After that, we’ll ask you to confirm or update it.  \n\n**Data shared includes:**  \n*For individuals:*  \n- First and last name  \n- Address  \n- Tax Identification Number (TIN)  \n- Date of birth  \n\n*For professionals:*  \n- Legal and trade name  \n- Business address  \n- SIREN  \n- VAT number (or SIREN/SIRET)  \n\n*For property rentals (individuals and professionals):*  \n- Property address  \n- Land registration number  \n- Number of rental days  \n\nReports are submitted annually by January 31 for the previous calendar year.  \nYou’ll receive a copy of the data sent by email.  \nRest assured, **AI-Bay** only collects and transmits the data required by DAC7 to the tax authorities.\n\n---\n\n### Where Can I Find My Tax Identification Number?\nThe TIN (Tax Identification Number) is issued by the French tax administration to every taxpayer.  \n**Authority:** Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (DGFiP)  \n**Format:** 01 23 456 789 012 (13 digits)  \nYou can find it on your income tax return or tax notice — it appears at the top of the first page.\n\n---\n\n### How Do I Provide My Tax Number?\nIf you meet the eligibility criteria, our team will notify you via:  \n- Informational emails  \n- Information banners displayed on the **AI-Bay** website and app (homepage, “My Account,” and wallet pages)  \n\nWhen you see this message, click “Provide My Information” to access the form.\n\n**Important:** To access the DAC7 form, make sure your identity verification (KYC) is complete. Once verified, you’ll see the banner and can enter your tax number.\n\n---\n\n### What Happens If I Don’t Complete the DAC7 Form?\nWe’ll send several reminders to complete the DAC7 form when required.  \nIf you fail to do so after reminders (or don’t provide your information at all) before year-end, we’ll have to restrict your **AI-Bay** account access:  \n- You won’t be able to withdraw money from your wallet.  \n- You won’t be able to use your wallet balance for purchases on **AI-Bay**.  \n- If your account is deleted, you won’t be able to access **AI-Bay** services or create a new account.  \n\nYou can regain full access by providing the required DAC7 information.\n\n---\n\n### Where Can I Find My Transaction History?\nYou can view your transactions under: **My Account > My Transactions**\n\n**Important:**  \nThis applies only to completed transactions made since January 1, 2023, and for each calendar year thereafter. Previous sales will not appear in any tax authority report.",

        "faq_body": "**Note:** As a host, using the online booking service offers several advantages. Learn more in *Why use the online booking service?*\n\nThe online booking feature allows travelers to book and pay for their stays directly through the AI-Bay platform. It’s also a great way to build trust with potential future guests.  \nThis service is completely free for you (0% commission on the booking amount) and is automatically available once you post your listing.\n\n**Here’s how to use the online booking service:**\n\n1. **Customize your listing for free**  \n   Post your rental listing by providing:  \n   - **Deposit amount:** Choose the deposit you want travelers to pay securely online when posting your listing (between 30% and 100% of the total stay). You can adjust it anytime from the “Listing” tab by clicking “Edit for free.”  \n   - **Prices and availability:** Once your listing is published, you’ll be redirected to your AI-Bay calendar, where you can set your prices and availability for specific dates.  \n\n   **Note:** Find more information about how your calendar works here.\n\n2. **Receive booking requests with deposits paid online**  \n   Travelers find your listing and send booking requests by paying the secure deposit directly on AI-Bay. You have 3 days to accept or decline these requests.  \n   You’ll be notified and can view requests in:  \n   - Your AI-Bay messages  \n   - Your calendar  \n   - The “Vacation Bookings” tab (iOS app only)  \n\n   You can chat with travelers anytime via AI-Bay messaging to discuss:  \n   - The rental agreement  \n   - Security deposits (if applicable)  \n   - Payment methods for the remaining balance  \n   - Arrival details  \n\n   **Note:** The more bookings you accept, the higher your listing appears in search results—up to 3 times more requests! Track your performance daily in your listing dashboard.\n\n3. **Accept or decline booking requests**  \n   You have 72 hours to accept or decline a booking.  \n   To respond, click **Accept** or **Decline** via:  \n   - The message conversation  \n   - The “My Bookings” tab in your account calendar  \n   - The booking summary email  \n\n   **Note:** If you don’t respond within 72 hours, the request automatically expires and the traveler won’t be charged.\n\n4. **Receive the secure deposit once the booking is accepted**  \n   After accepting a booking on the AI-Bay site or app, enter your IBAN and ID documents in your personal account.  \n   We transfer the secure deposit to your bank account 48 hours after the travelers’ arrival to ensure a trustworthy experience. The funds will appear in your account within 5–7 business days, depending on your bank.\n\n5. **Enjoy peace of mind**  \n   We collect and remit the tourist tax (non-flat rate) on your behalf.  \n   You can cancel bookings if something unexpected happens:  \n   - If you cancel, we refund the traveler’s online payment (deposit, service fees, tourist tax).  \n   - If travelers cancel less than 30 days before arrival, you receive the deposit in your bank account.  \n\n   **Note:** Bookings cannot be canceled less than 24 hours before the stay begins. In case of emergency, contact customer support.\n\n6. **Welcome your travelers with confidence**  \n   Upon arrival, the traveler pays the remaining balance using your chosen payment method (check, holiday voucher, cash, bank transfer, etc.).  \n\n   **Note:** After the stay, both you and the traveler will be asked to leave a review.

        "faq_body": "How AI-Bay search results work  \nListings in the “Vacation” category are sorted based on relevance.  \nThe AI-Bay algorithm takes into account travelers’ search criteria to show them listings that best match their expectations, as well as how effectively hosts use the online booking service.  \n\nTips to boost your listing’s visibility:  \n1. Accept and honor online booking requests  \nTo increase the likelihood that a traveler’s booking request is successful, the algorithm highlights listings with a good acceptance rate.  \nThe more you accept and fulfill booking requests, the more reliable your listing appears — and the higher it will rank.  \nTo learn more, see “How does the acceptance rate work?”  \n\n2. Keep your calendar and prices up to date  \nBy maintaining an updated calendar, you avoid unwanted booking requests that you’d have to decline — which could hurt your acceptance rate and, in turn, your ranking.  \nYour listing’s price also matters: adjust it according to the season to stay competitive.  \nTo learn more, see “How to manage my calendar’s prices and availability?” and “How to sync my booking calendar?”  \n\n3. Subscribe to a highlight option  \nIf you want a quick and effective way to improve your listing’s ranking, you can subscribe to a highlight option that boosts your visibility in search results. Several options are available:  \n- Immediately  \n- Daily for 7 days  \n- Daily for 30 days  \n- Weekly for 60 days  \n\nTo subscribe, go to your list of listings and click “Rent faster.”  \n\nCan I move my listing to the top by deleting and reposting it?  \nDeleting and reposting a listing will not make it appear at the top of search results. In fact, doing so can be counterproductive, as you’ll lose your booking history and performance data.  \nTo improve your ranking, it’s better to enhance your existing listing rather than start from scratch.  \n\nNote: If you no longer wish to receive booking requests, you can pause your listing.",

        "faq_body": "**What Is the Acceptance Rate?**\n\nThe acceptance rate represents the percentage of booking requests you’ve accepted out of all the requests you’ve received since creating your account. This indicator helps travelers understand how often you accept or decline bookings.\n\nThe higher your acceptance rate, the higher your listings appear in search results.  \nIf you’ve accepted at least two bookings and your rate exceeds 75%, you become a **Recommended Host**, a mark of trust for travelers. You’ll also earn a badge that boosts your listing’s visibility and increases your chances of receiving booking requests.\n\n**Note:** A low acceptance rate appears on your listing and reduces its visibility.\n\n**How to Improve Your Acceptance Rate**\n\n- **Keep your calendar updated:** Regularly updating your calendar is key. If your prices and availability are accurate, you’ll receive relevant booking requests that you’re more likely to accept. (See: How to manage prices and availability in my calendar?)  \n- **Provide house rules:** When posting your listing, fill in all property details and write a complete description. This helps attract more suitable booking requests.  \n- **Use the pause feature:** If you’re unable to respond to requests, you can pause your listing. It will temporarily disappear from search results, and you won’t receive new requests.\n\n**Note:** Your search ranking isn’t determined solely by your acceptance rate. Occasional refusals are fine — what matters is maintaining a higher proportion of accepted requests.\n\n**What Happens If I Accept a Booking but Don’t Honor the Stay?**\n\nRemember, you cannot cancel a booking less than 24 hours before the stay begins. If the stay cannot take place, the booking will be canceled by our customer service or the traveler, which will negatively affect your acceptance rate.  \nKeep your calendar up to date to ensure you only accept bookings that match your real availability.",

This starts a 7-day amicable resolution phase during which you can agree on a solution with the buyer.  \n\nNote: If no solution is found within 7 days after the buyer reports the issue, the AI-Bay team will automatically step in. It’s also possible to open a dispute 48 hours after the start of the amicable resolution phase.  \n\nSolution 1: Ask the buyer to return the package, then issue a refund  \nThe simplest option is to arrange for the return of the package in exchange for a refund. To do this:  \n- Provide the buyer with the return address.  \n- Agree on the return terms (shipping costs, carrier choice).  \n- Wait for the package to be returned and check its condition upon arrival. Report any issues to the carrier (if using Mondial Relay or Shop2Shop by Chronopost, you can note a reservation when collecting the package).  \n- Confirm the return and refund from your AI-Bay messages by clicking “I refund the buyer” (if the button doesn’t appear, contact our support team).  \nThe refund will be processed automatically.  \n\nSolution 2: Issue a refund without requesting the return  \nIf the product is too damaged, of low value, or you simply don’t want it back, you can refund the buyer without requesting a return. To do this:  \n- Inform the buyer that a return isn’t necessary and that you’re initiating the refund.  \n- From your messages, click “I refund the buyer.”  \nThe refund will be processed automatically.  \n\nSolution 3: Offer compensation to the buyer  \nIf the buyer wants to keep the product but feels compensation is appropriate:  \n- Discuss and agree on the amount of the discount.  \n- Decide on the payment method (bank transfer, check, etc.).  \n- Proceed with the compensation payment.  \nThe buyer can then finalize the sale by clicking “Release payment” from their AI-Bay messages.  \nYou will then receive the full payment for the sale.",

Fill out the contact form describing your issue.  \n\nYour transaction will then be paused until the issue is resolved.  \n\n---\n\n**Important:** If you haven’t reported anything (neither received nor not received) after 15 days, we’ll assume the parcel has been received.

        "faq_body": "Declare your income earned through AI-Bay  \n\n**Legal framework**  \n**Tax framework**  \n\n**Special cases**  \n- Renting part of your main residence  \n- Renting your secondary residence or part of your main residence  \n- Assistance from Climb (formerly Tacotax)  \n\n**Collecting the tourist tax**  \n**Declaring property occupancy**  \n\n### Declare your income earned through AI-Bay\nYou may be liable for income tax on earnings from renting your property through our platform.  \nAt the beginning of each year, we will send you a summary of the amounts received from your rental transactions on AI-Bay to help you with your tax declaration.  \n\n#### Legal framework\nIncome from renting a furnished property on AI-Bay is considered *Industrial and Commercial Profits (BIC)*. You must declare it as a *Non-Professional Furnished Landlord (LMNP)*.  \n\n> Note: These are not property income (which applies only to unfurnished rentals).  \n\n#### Tax framework\nWhen declaring as an LMNP, you can choose between two regimes if your annual gross income is below €77,700 for classified tourist rentals and guest rooms, or €15,000 for unclassified tourist rentals.  \n\n**Micro-BIC regime**  \nFor income earned from January 1, 2025:  \n- The micro-BIC regime applies if you have not opted for the real profit regime and if your previous year’s turnover (excluding tax) does not exceed €15,000 for unclassified tourist rentals or €77,700 for classified tourist rentals and guest rooms.  \n- For classified tourist rentals and guest rooms, you benefit from a 50% deduction on your gross income.  \n- For unclassified tourist rentals, the deduction is 30%.  \n- To declare, enter the gross income amount in form 2042 C PRO, under “Non-professional furnished rental income,” subcategory “micro-BIC regime,” boxes 5ND and following.  \n\nFor income earned during 2024, the previous tax rules apply:  \n- The micro-BIC regime applies if you have not opted for the real profit regime and if your previous year’s turnover (excluding tax) does not exceed €77,700 for unclassified tourist rentals or €188,700 for classified tourist rentals and guest rooms.  \n- For classified tourist rentals and guest rooms, you benefit from a 71% deduction on your gross income.  \n- For unclassified tourist rentals, the deduction is 50%.  \n\n**Real profit regime**  \nIf your annual gross income exceeds €70,000, you are automatically subject to the real profit regime.  \nYou can then deduct actual expenses and costs related to this activity.  \nTo declare, enter the net income amount in form 2042 C PRO, under “Non-professional furnished rental income,” subcategory “real profit regime,” boxes 5NA and following.  \n\n> Note: The net income amount is calculated using form 2031-SD, which generally requires assistance from a certified accountant.  \n\n#### Special cases\n**Renting part of your main residence**  \nIf you rent or sublet one or more rooms in your main home, you are exempt from income tax if the total rent received during the year does not exceed €760 (including tax). In that case, you do not need to declare it.  \nIf you exceed €760, you must declare the full amount and will be taxed on the total.  \n\n**Renting your secondary residence**  \nThe minimum deduction is €305, meaning that if you earn less than €305, you will not owe any tax. However, you must still declare the income.  \n\n**Assistance from Climb (formerly Tacotax)**  \nIf you have questions, we have partnered with Climb, which can provide more information and assist you with your tax declarations. On Climb, you will find:  \n- A detailed guide on the tax rules applicable to income from your activities on AI-Bay.  \n- A page where you can ask Climb experts questions related to your hosting activity on AI-Bay.  \n\n#### Collecting the tourist tax\nMunicipalities may require visitors staying in their area to pay a tourist tax.  \nThis tax helps fund tourism-related expenses or the protection of natural tourist areas.  \nSince January 1, 2019, AI-Bay collects the non-flat-rate tourist tax on behalf of hosts using the online booking service on AI-Bay. We then transfer the collected tax to the relevant municipalities for each booking made on AI-Bay.  \nYou can find more information about the tourist tax here.  \n\n#### Declaring property occupancy\nSince January 1, 2023, the residence tax has been abolished for all main residences.  \nTo identify property owners still liable for the tax (secondary homes, rental properties), the French tax authority (DGFIP) requires all property owners—of main, secondary, or rented homes—to submit an additional declaration via their personal or professional space on [https://impots.gouv.fr/](https://impots.gouv.fr/) under the “Manage my properties” tab. This must be done before July 1, 2023.  \nThe declaration must be updated each year between January 1 and July 1 only if there has been a change since the last submission (e.g., change in occupancy). If nothing has changed, no new declaration is required.  \nFor seasonal rentals, you must declare the start of the rental period, management details (self-managed or via a manager), the manager’s or owner’s SIREN number, and any tourist classification.  \nThe online form adapts based on your answers. For seasonal rentals, DGFIP does not request tenant identities.  \nFailure to comply results in a €150 fine per property for missing or inaccurate information.",

Wait 24 hours before disposing of it with household waste.  \n- Wash clothes worn during cleaning at 60°C in the washing machine.\n\n---\n\n### Cleaning Equipment to Use\n\n**Mask**  \nSingle-use or washable after each use.\n\n**Gloves**  \nSingle-use; discard after cleaning. Wash your hands before and after wearing gloves.\n\n**Cleaning product**  \nCommercial multi-surface cleaner or a mix of water and soap.\n\n**Virucidal product**  \nDo not mix with hot water, as it may reduce its effectiveness. Note that many detergents are not disinfectants.\n\n**Cleaning cloths**  \nSingle-use or machine-washable at 60°C (cloths, mops, sponges, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Cleaning the Interior of the Accommodation\n\n✔ To minimize virus transmission and properly prepare for guests, follow these steps:  \n✔ Remove sheets and textiles.  \n✔ Air out rooms for at least 15–30 minutes.  \n✔ Run water in the kitchen and bathroom to flush stagnant water.  \n✔ Clean all surfaces.  \n✔ Disinfect floors with a virucidal product or diluted bleach (0.5% active chlorine).  \n✔ Disinfect contact points (door handles, chairs, switches, remote controls, etc.) with diluted bleach.  \n✔ Wash dishes and utensils (preferably in a dishwasher).  \n✔ Wash sheets and linens at 60°C.\n\n---\n\n### Cleaning the Exterior of the Accommodation\n\nIf your property has a balcony, terrace, or garden, follow these steps:  \n✔ Dust and clean surfaces with a cleaning product.  \n✔ Disinfect the terrace.  \n✔ Disinfect contact surfaces.\n\n---\n\n### Restocking the Apartment\n\nIf you need to restock the apartment for new guests, follow these steps:  \n✔ Place shopping bags on the floor and remove as much packaging as possible.  \n✔ Wash your hands.  \n✔ Put away the groceries.  \n✔ Wash your hands again.\n\n---\n\n### Learn More\n\n- The UNPLV (National Union for the Promotion of Vacation Rentals) health protocol  \n- Health recommendations to share with travelers",

        "faq_body": "As a host of a property with a swimming pool or located near a body of water, it’s essential to raise awareness among travelers about the dangers of swimming, especially for families.\n\nDid you know?\n\n- Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death among people under 25.  \n- Accidental drownings account for around 1,000 deaths per year in France.  \n- The number of drownings triples during heatwaves.  \n- One in four drownings is fatal.  \n(Source: sports.gouv.fr)\n\n**Preventing drowning among children**  \nMost accidental drownings involving children (especially those under 6) occur in swimming pools, often when the child cannot swim and supervision is lacking.  \nTo prevent these accidents, here are some recommendations from the Ministry of Solidarity and Health to share with your travelers:\n\n- Constantly supervise children and swim with them, even in monitored areas.  \n- Ensure that each child is watched by one responsible adult.  \n- Avoid using your phone or tablet while supervising.  \n- Never leave, even for a short moment.  \n- Be extra cautious with above-ground pools, as they often lack safety devices.\n\nIf a child has swallowed water, watch for the following symptoms:\n\n- Fatigue or drowsiness  \n- Coughing, shortness of breath, or blue lips  \n- Vomiting  \n- Unusual behavior  \n\nIf one or more of these symptoms persist after several minutes, call emergency services immediately.  \n(Source: solidarites-sante.gouv.fr)\n\n**Note:** If your property includes a swimming pool, consult the Ministry of the Interior’s recommendations regarding safety equipment for private pools.\n\n**Preventing drowning among adults**  \nAdults are not immune to drowning, particularly in rivers, lakes, and the sea. These incidents are often linked to alcohol consumption, unsupervised activities (diving, apnea, etc.), falls, or sudden illness.  \nTo prevent accidental drownings, share the following safety tips with your travelers:\n\n- Follow safety instructions and choose supervised swimming areas.  \n- Check weather conditions before swimming.  \n- Be aware of your physical condition (fatigue, illness, etc.) and don’t overestimate your swimming ability.  \n- Avoid alcohol before swimming.  \n- Inform someone before going for a swim.\n\nBe cautious of thermal shock, caused by a large temperature difference between air and water. If you experience cramps, chills, vision or hearing issues, itching, headaches, or fatigue, get out of the water immediately to warm up. If symptoms persist, call emergency services.  \n(Recommendations from the Ministry of Solidarity and Health)\n\n**Emergency numbers**\n\n- SAMU: 15  \n- Firefighters: 18  \n- European emergency number: 112  \n\nFor more information, visit:  \n- solidarites-sante.gouv.fr  \n- sports.gouv.fr  \n\n**Note:** You can download printable prevention posters.",

        "faq_body": "Renting a vacation property should be a smooth and enjoyable experience from start to finish—for both travelers and hosts. To support this, AI-Bay helps hosts prevent noise disturbances and other behaviors that could disrupt neighborhood peace.\n\n**How to prevent noise disturbances?**  \nAs a host, it’s your responsibility to minimize the risk of noise issues caused by your guests. Here are some recommendations:\n\n- **Craft a clear listing description:** Use your listing to establish clear house rules stating that parties and events likely to cause noise are prohibited. Emphasize respect for neighbors and shared spaces.  \n- **Review booking requests carefully:** Check guest profiles and don’t hesitate to contact them for more details about their stay. Pay special attention to local guests or large groups.  \n- **Install a noise monitoring device:** Some devices allow you to monitor your property remotely and detect excessive noise. If you choose to install such equipment (excluding bathrooms and private areas), you must inform guests, who have the right to refuse.  \n- **Communicate with your neighbors:** Be transparent about your regular rentals and share your contact details so they can reach you if needed.  \n- **Promote awareness on-site:** Post reminders inside the property to inform guests who may have missed the online information.\n\n**How to respond to noise disturbances**  \nDespite preventive measures, unauthorized parties or disruptive events may still occur. If neighbors alert you to unusual behavior:\n\n- Try to communicate with your guests and remind them of the house rules.  \n- If the noise continues, consider contacting local authorities, who can take appropriate action.  \n- If you used AI-Bay’s secure payment service, remember to rate the traveler afterward to help prevent similar incidents.\n\n**Note:** If a noise complaint is filed with local authorities, your listing may be removed from the AI-Bay platform. This makes proactive prevention all the more important.",
