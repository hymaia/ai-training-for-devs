      "- For a delivery marked as delivered but not available at the pickup point, AI-Bay asks the buyer to report the issue to the pickup location and to contact AI-Bay Customer Service (Documents 2 and 3).\n",
      "- If the buyer has not confirmed receipt within 15 days after shipment confirmation (or hasn’t requested assistance), the payment is automatically released to you and appears in your AI-Bay wallet (Documents 2 and 3). Average timing is listed as within 24 hours after release, excluding weekends/holidays.\n",
      "- For ongoing issues, you’re advised to coordinate via AI-Bay messaging and have the buyer and carrier/ pickup point involved (Documents 2, 3, and 4).\n",

      "- Encourage the buyer to report the issue to the pickup location and contact AI-Bay Customer Service.\n",

      "If you’d like, I can pull out the exact steps to take next or guide you through what to tell the buyer. The core payment rule in these cases is the automatic release after 15 days if there’s no receipt confirmation or assistance requested by the buyer.\n"
